    <h1><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong></h1>
    <p>These terms and conditions ("Terms", "Agreement") are an agreement between Zoltan Dross ("Mobile Application Developer", "us", "we" or "our") and you ("User", "you" or "your"). This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the mobile application and any of its products or services (collectively, "Mobile Application" or "Services").</p>
    
    <h2><strong>App does NOT collect any face data.</strong></h2>
    <p>App stores only photos that the user creates in app. These photos are stored locally on the user's device and are NOT transferred to third parties or services. Only users have access to them.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></h2>
    <p>This Application is provided strictly on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Use of the Service is at Users’ own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Owner expressly disclaims all conditions, representations, and warranties — whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by the User from the Owner or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.</p>
    <p>Without limiting the foregoing, the developer does not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable, or correct; that the Service will meet Users’ requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected. Any content, advice, tips are used at the Users own risk and Users shall be solely responsible for any damage.</p>
    <p>We provide general basic tips. We do not offer medical guidance and advice. All recommendations and advice should be considered as suggestions! Please consult with a professional and do your own research before doing some new actions.</p>

    <h3><strong>Additional Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></h3>
    <h4>a. Basic Disclaimers of Warranties.</h4>
    <p>EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THE SERVICE AND PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, AND LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AS WELL AS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AS TO PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED BY BUSINESSES LISTED ON THE SERVICE.</p>
    <p>In particular, the released parties make no, and expressly disclaim any warranty that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the Service will meet your requirements,</li>
        <li>the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free,</li>
        <li>the results that may be obtained from the use of the Service, including data, will be accurate or reliable,</li>
        <li>the quality of any data or service available on the Service will meet your expectations, and</li>
        <li>any errors in the service will be corrected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any material obtained through the use of the Service is accessed at your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from the use of any such material.</p>
    <p>We cannot guarantee and do not promise any specific results from the use of the App and/or the Service. You agree also to take the risks of interruption of the Service for any technical reasons.</p>

    <h4>b. Absence of Any Advice on the Service</h4>
    <p>Any statement that may be posted on the Service is for informational and entertainment purposes only and is not intended to replace or substitute for any professional financial, medical, legal, or other advice.</p>
    <p>The Company makes no representations or warranties and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, expressly disclaims any and all liability relating to your reliance on the statements or other information offered or provided within or through the Service. If you have specific concerns or a situation arises in which you require professional or medical advice, you should consult with an appropriately trained and qualified specialist.</p>

    <h2><strong>Backups</strong></h2>
    <p>We are not responsible for Content residing in the Mobile Application. In no event shall we be held liable for any loss of any Content. It is your sole responsibility to maintain an appropriate backup of your Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on some occasions and in certain circumstances, with absolutely no obligation, we may be able to restore some or all of your data that has been deleted as of a certain date and time when we may have backed up data for our own purposes. We make no guarantee that the data you need will be available.</p>

    <h2><strong>Links to Other Mobile Applications</strong></h2>
    <p>Although this Mobile Application may link to other mobile applications, we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked mobile application, unless specifically stated herein. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their mobile applications. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third-parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any mobile application which you access through a link from this Mobile Application. Your linking to any other off-site mobile applications is at your own risk.</p>

    <h2><strong>Changes and Amendments</strong></h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its policies relating to the Mobile Application or Services at any time, effective upon posting of an updated version of this Agreement in the Mobile Application. When we do, we will post a notification in our Mobile Application. Continued use of the Mobile Application after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.</p>

    <h2><strong>Subscription</strong></h2>
    <p>The app has an optional subscription. Subscription fees can be found in the mobile applications.</p>
    <p>This price is for United States customers. Pricing in other countries may vary and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on the country of residence.</p>
    <p>The purchase will be charged to your iTunes account. Once you're a subscriber, you can manage your subscription from iTunes or on your iOS unit after purchasing it, and you'll also be able to cancel the auto-renewing subscription from there. Deleting the app does not cancel the subscription. You can, however, cancel a subscription even after you've deleted the app. The subscription will auto-renew 24 hours before the subscription period ends, with the same kind of subscription you already bought, to the same price.</p>
    <p>You may at any time terminate your membership, in which case your membership will still be valid for the subscription time you have already paid for. Our auto-renewable In-app purchase subscriptions can only be cancelled using the App Store cancellation service. We reserve the right to change the subscription fees from time to time.</p>

    <h2><strong>Acceptance of These Terms</strong></h2>
    <p>You acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and agree to all its terms and conditions. By using the Mobile Application or its Services you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Agreement, you are not authorized to use or access the Mobile Application and its Services.</p>
